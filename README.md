# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project aims to analyze Kickstarter data to uncover trends that better inform the genesis of a Kickstarter campaign to raise money to fund a play.

## Analysis and Challenges
Several insights were found after a thorough analysis of the Kickstarter data, namely from the outcomes based on launch date and goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The success rate of the theater campaigns took a substantial jump if they were started in May, only declining slightly through July. This period seems to be the optimal time to begin the campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The estimated cost of the given project is more than $10,000. Upon analysis of the relationship between a project's goal and its outcome, it became clear that a goal closer to $10,000 would provide the greatest chance of success. Projects with goals between $10,000 and $20,000 had an average success rate of 50%, with a lesser chance on the higher end of the range. The next best window is between $35,000 and $45,000. Therefore, the best course of action would be to either keep the goal as close to $10,000 as possible while maintaining project viability or increase the goal substantially to $35,000 - $40,000.

## Results
The optimal plan for a potential theater campaign seems to be a launch date in May, with a goal of around $10,000. The dataset may have limitations to consider. For example, the data does not contain the reason a campaign failed or was canceled. It may be inferred that many were due to a shortage of funds, but other factors may have contributed. There are also several outliers within the data set that may have thrown off some of the findings. It may be helpful to consult a scatter or box plot to visualize these outliers.
